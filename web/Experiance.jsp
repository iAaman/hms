              The Gol Bungalow that forms the tail end of the palace has a dome structure 
              with stained glass work along with an iron protrusion which seems like the 
              sting of the scorpion. With breath taking views of the old city and the stained
              glass dome, makes this location a quintessential venue for a divine breakfast or 
              romantic dinner. Head to Gol Bungalow for a subline evening under the stars, 
              with the city at your feet.

               Imagine a pathway lit-up with candles in silver holders hung on
               either wrought iron lantern holders or raw wooden tripods. 
               The guests are then escorted from the 5-series path side.
               They arrive to glasses of Prosecco and treat their senses to a
               5 course meal. 
               Food for thought.
